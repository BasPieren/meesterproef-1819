## Description 📝

In this repo I will describe my personal learning goals that I had set for the meesterproef, why I had set them and what I have done to acieve them. To see the project itself go [here](https://github.com/RobinStut/meesterproef/tree/development).

## The Project 🏷

Within the Southeast district of Amsterdam, the Sports promotion department is responsible for implementing the local sports promotion policy. The department is working on an accessible sports environment for all Amsterdam residents, where everyone can find the offer that suits him / her and can enjoy the sport. The Sports Stimulation department in Southeast has the desire to bring all sports, from events to workshops, to the center of attention through an app.

I worked on this project togheter with three other students: [Robin Stut](https://github.com/RobinStut), [Sterre van Geest](https://github.com/sterrevangeest) and [Jesse Dijkman](https://github.com/jesseDijkman1). Although we were working togheter on this project, it was also important that we worked on our own personal learning goals.

Our team worked togheter with four students from the UX minor to create a socail web app that could be used by both residetns of Southeast, sportproviders and sportsbrokers as a way to make more people join sportsclubs in Southeast.

## Learning Goals 🎓

These are my learing goals for the meesterproef:

- **Web App From Scratch**
  - _App structure and code quality:_ In this project I want to pay close attetion to setting up the project in a modules and making sure we follow code guidlines.
  - _Retrieve, manipulate and display data:_ Since there is the potential that there will be a lot data that is displayed, I want to look into client side maniplution of that data.
- **CSS To The Rescue**
  - _The Student understands the broader scope of CSS:_ I want to apply [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) since I didn't get the opportunity during the CSS To The Rescue course.
- **Real Time Web**
  - _Data Managment:_ I want to put extra though into data managment since I wasn't really able to do this in the Real Time Web course.

## Product Biografie 🛠️

Here I will describe the process of each week.

### Week 1

_27-31 juli_

Altough the project officially started in the week of the 27th of juli we had the kick-off a week earlier. During the kick-off we sat down with Harry, Daan and the UX students. Harry gave a brief intro where he talked about what the project wants to acieve: To get more people to join a sports club. He continued by saying that there is a lot of offer but just not enough partisipants. So he wants to create platform where all the information that is already out there comes togheter in one place, a webapp/website.

The UX students already started working on the project 2 weeks earlier during their minor and they presented the early stages of their concepts. They all basically came down to the same thing: A place where people can share and lookup sports, stories and events and find out what sports fits them through a online quiz. They want sport providers to have a seperate enviorment where they can create events and add other information about their sport club/organization to the platform.

We then started discussing what we could and what we could not do. The whay we saw it we could setup most of the platform, even if it where just static pages, and then work out what was really needed. Due to the lack of wireframes at the moment we weren't really able to make a clear promise of what we would deliver.

The plan for the first week was that the UX'ers would finish their wireframes on monday and present them to us and Harry on thuesday.
