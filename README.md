## Description 📝

In this repo I will describe my personal learning goals that I had set for the meesterproef, why I had set them and what I have done to acieve them. To see the project itself go [here](https://github.com/RobinStut/meesterproef/tree/development).

## The Project 🏷

Within the Southeast district of Amsterdam, the Sports promotion department is responsible for implementing the local sports promotion policy. The department is working on an accessible sports environment for all Amsterdam residents, where everyone can find the offer that suits him / her and can enjoy the sport. The Sports Stimulation department in Southeast has the desire to bring all sports, from events to workshops, to the center of attention through an app.

I worked on this project togheter with three other students: [Robin Stut](https://github.com/RobinStut), [Sterre van Geest](https://github.com/sterrevangeest) and [Jesse Dijkman](https://github.com/jesseDijkman1). Although we were working togheter on this project, it was also important that we worked on our own personal learning goals.

Our team worked togheter with four students from the UX minor to create a socail web app that could be used by both residetns of Southeast, sportproviders and sportsbrokers as a way to make more people join sportsclubs in Southeast.

## Learning Goals 🎓

These are my learing goals for the meesterproef:

- **Web App From Scratch**
  - _App structure and code quality:_ In this project I want to pay close attetion to setting up the project in a modules and making sure we follow code guidlines.
  - _Retrieve, manipulate and display data:_ Since there is the potential that there will be a lot data that is displayed, I want to look into client side maniplution of that data.
- **CSS To The Rescue**
  - _The Student understands the broader scope of CSS:_ I want to apply [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) since I didn't get the opportunity during the CSS To The Rescue course.
- **Real Time Web**
  - _Data Managment:_ I want to put extra though into data managment since I wasn't really able to do this in the Real Time Web course.

## Design Rationale 📑

See the following [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/@meesterproef/s/design-rationale/) for the design rationale.

## Product Biography 🛠️

Here I will describe the process of each week.

### Week 1

_27-31 juli_

Altough the project officially started in the week of the 27th of juli we had the kick-off a week earlier. During the kick-off we sat down with Harry from the sports promotion department, Daan from 'Academie van de Stad' and the UX students from the UX minor. Harry gave a brief intro where he talked about what the project wants to acieve: To get more people to join a sports club. He continued by saying that there is a lot of offer but just not enough partisipants. So he wants to create platform where all the information that is already out there comes togheter in one place, a webapp/website.

The UX students already started working on the project 2 weeks earlier during their minor and they presented the early stages of their concepts. They all basically came down to the same thing: A place where people can share and lookup sports, stories and events and find out what sports fits them through a online quiz. They want sport providers to have a seperate enviorment where they can create events and add other information about their sport club/organization to the platform.

We then started discussing what we could and what we could not do. The whay we saw it we could setup most of the platform, even if it where just static pages, and then work out what was really needed. Due to the lack of wireframes at the moment we weren't really able to make a clear promise of what we would deliver.

The plan for the first week was that the UX'ers would finish their wireframes on monday and present them to us and Harry on thuesday.

On thuesday the 28th the UX students gave their presentation where they adressed the following points:

###### The Problem

> "There are many sport providers in Zuidoost (around 180), but the participation of the inhabitants (around 900.000) in sport activities there is the lowest in whole Amsterdam. Providers often have difficulty in spotlighting their offer and potential users may have problems to find what they are looking for." - UX Students

###### The Assignment

> "Design digital interfaces so the full range of sports in Zuidoost in the first place and secondly for whole Amsterdam can be reached. The platform should function as an overview for all sport offerings." - UX Students

The most important goal is to: **"Increase sport activity of the inhabitants of Zuidoost."**

The platform should be focusing on the following aspects:

- Information
- Self-Actualization
- Community

After that the UX students presented their wireframes. Harry was very happy with the progress so far and would provide us with people so we could test the wireframes in week 2.

We, the team of web dev students, said that we would start setting up the project the following day.

### Week 2

_3-8 juni_

We started the second week by continuing to project setup. During the (long) weekend we also had made agreements with the test groups that we were put into contact with by Harry and Daan that we would be testing on thuesday. The test group consistet of young people from a local school between the ages of 12 and 17 and a sportprovider named Gilbert who turned out to be a coach for a walking soccer team which consisted of elderly people.

On monday we started by setting up a simple HTML and CSS prototype. We dind't want to work to far ahead since we would be testing the next day and the concept could change. We also met the the UX students to go over the (new) wireframes and discuss the testing for thuesday. Me and Jesse would join Johanna to go and test with Gilbert and Robin and Sterre would join Lisa and Christian to test at the local school.

On thuesday me, Jesse and Johanna met with Gilbert and his people. What should have been a user test of the wireframe prototype that Johanna had build turnt more into a interview which didn't really matter because we got alot of usefull information. For Gilbert and his people, which were mostly all elderly, the most important thing was to stay healthy and keep moving. They didn't what to be stuck at home with nothing to do.

An other important aspect was the social one. They got to meet alot of people which they would continue to see both on and off the field. This creates a real community. They also highlighted that the webapp should be able to be used by older and newer devices, both mobile and desktop, because not everybody in Southeast has a smarthphone.

After the tests we met with the rest of the team to discuss results. After that we went to the Bijlmer Sportpark to meet with Daan and Vincent, a sportsbroker who would fill on for Harry because he was on vacation. Here we once again discussed testing results and got some usefull feedback from Vincent. He told us that a lot of times people come to him with questions about where their childeren could sport. For him to have a list of all sports and clubs would be really helpfull. He also gave us an other lead for potential testing groups.

The rest of the week we started working on actually making stuff. The goal was to finish the homepage and have a semi working quiz by the start of next week so we could test again. Working with four developers on one project was kind of a challange for us since whe had never done it before. So whe had do dive in to using Git branches and start setting up modules.

Our folder structure looked something like this:

```
root
|
|- data
|  |
|  |- json
|  |- raw
|
|- modules
|
|- public
|  |
|  |- css
|  |  |
|  |  |- modules
|  |  |- styles.css
|  |- images
|  |- js
|  |  |- modules
|  |  |- script.js
|
|- views
|  |
|  |- pages
|  |  |- index.ejs
|  |- partials
|
|- app.js
|
```

The most important thing was to use modules. If we would made sure everybody was working on their own modules we would eliminate a large part of the merge conflicts.

On thursday Sterre had finished a visual design that would act as our baseline for the UI. I started working on applying the styles to the HTML/CSS prototype for the rest of the week.

On friday we also had our first meeting with Koop in which we discussed the progress of the project. And I will be honest that I got kind of... vocal. I pointed out that I wasn't to happy with how the UX'ers where using us to make the testing appointments because, them speaking english, they fought it would be better if we did it which kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Whe then started discussing the cooperation between the two minors and Koop pointed out some serious flawes in the concept and found it more of an idea than a serious concept. I dind't really see the problem, we are the developers in this situation, we make the stuff they come up with. Concepting is their speciality.

Koop saw this differently. He said we needed to be more active in the concepting process and build more prototypes to test asumptions/ideas. I disagreed. I said that I dind't choose the web dev minor to start working on concepts and that I wanted to make one single solid product, not a bunch of spaghetti code prototypes.

Now I said I understaind that we come from CMD, we are not brainless developers that just make what they are given. But for the meesterproef we get graded for what we make, not the concept. Koop still disagreed. I said "Well I choose the wrong project then."

So after our meeting we said down and started prioretising the most important features in the app. Whe made a MoSCow chart. I would start working out the sport provider flow of creating events since I wanted to focus on data managment.

### Week 3

_10-14 juni_

On thuesday I finished up the HTML/CSS prototype. Since me and Sterre where occupied for the rest of the day Robin and Jesse went on to sit down with the UX'ers and discuss the quiz, which was nearing its stage of being functional, and show how the prototype was looking.

> Robin and Jesse meeting with the UX'ers.

Then on wednesday I started to work on creating events as a sport provider. I started by thinking and drawing out how I wanted the data to flow through the application. These are a couple of very lo-fi sketches.

![Sketch 1](https://i.imgur.com/GgvZTpH.jpg)

![Sketch 2](https://i.imgur.com/fEkSBtB.jpg)

I really wanted to make sure the data flow would be as well thought out as possible and make sure it was ready for real life situation. I was thinking about a couple of different things: How is the data model gonna look? Do I store event data together with sport provider data? Where am I gonna store the data? What data do I even need for a event?

I started by setting up a basic HTML `form` and started adding `input` fields like title, description, date etc. Since we would not work with a real database I had to save on the server. So alot of my time in the third week went into setting up the user flow and thinking about how I wanted the data to look and behave.

At the end of the week we also had a other meeting with Koop. We discussed our progress and showed him the now pretty much finished quiz. We also continued our conversation about working togheter with the UX'ers. It became pretty cleat that we just could not wait for them to develop their concept further. We also had the feeling that the UX'ers don't really know what to expect of us, what we can do. They are very much stuck in their personal grading and are focusing less on the project and the team work that could be happening but just isn't.
